<h1 align="center">Tomorrowland Music Festival Website</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://razvansy.github.io/1st-maelstone-project/)

## This website is about Tomorrowland music festival and It's a one page website. 
## I choose to do it like this for a better performance and mostly to get rid of the loading time when accessing separatly pages.

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used very often, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
